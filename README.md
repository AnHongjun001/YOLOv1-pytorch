# YOLOv1-pytorch
This is a pure pytorch implementation for YOLOv1. 
Note that this is not an official implementation, 
only for me to learn details of **Object Detection** and 
entertainment. 

In the process of my study, I found that it is
not easy to build DarkNet environment, especailly on Windows,
so I wrote this repo, YOLOv1 in pure pytorch. I'm going to 
write a simple and easy-to-use reproduction version of yolov1.

## The project is under development. Please look forward to it.
